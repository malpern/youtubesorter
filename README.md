## Stability Notice

This project maintains a stable codebase with well-defined interfaces and thorough test coverage. To ensure reliability:

- Core APIs and interfaces are stable and well-tested
- Major refactoring requires team discussion and approval
- Changes must maintain backward compatibility
- All modifications need test coverage
- See [Implementation Guide](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) for details

## Quick Start

1. **Install the package**
```bash
python -m pip install uv  # if you don't have uv installed
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or `.venv/Scripts/activate` on Windows
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Set up YouTube API credentials**
```bash
# Create a .env file with your credentials
echo "YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_api_key" > .env
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key" >> .env
```

3. **Start organizing!**

CLI Mode:
```bash
# Consolidate videos about keyboards from multiple playlists
youtubeconsolidate playlist1 playlist2 -t target_playlist -p "Videos about mechanical keyboards"

# Distribute videos to themed playlists
youtubedistribute source_playlist -t "gaming:Gaming videos,music:Music videos"

# Remove duplicates from a playlist
youtubededuplicate playlist_id
```

Web API Mode:
```bash
# Start the web server
uvicorn youtubesorter.webapi:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

## Key Commands

### CLI Commands

#### Consolidate
Gather matching videos from multiple source playlists into one:
```bash
youtubeconsolidate [source_playlists...] -t TARGET_PLAYLIST -p "filter prompt"
```

#### Distribute
Send videos from one playlist to many based on content:
```bash
youtubedistribute SOURCE_PLAYLIST -t "playlist1:prompt1,playlist2:prompt2"
```

#### Deduplicate
Remove duplicate videos from a playlist:
```bash
youtubededuplicate PLAYLIST_ID [options]
```

### Web API Endpoints

```bash
POST /consolidate
{
    "source_playlists": ["playlist1", "playlist2"],
    "target_playlist": "target",
    "copy": false,
    "limit": null,
    "verbose": false,
    "resume": false,
    "retry_failed": false
}
```
