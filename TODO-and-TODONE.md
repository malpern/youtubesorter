## Implementation Progress

### Milestone 1: Authentication & Basic Retrieval ✅
- OAuth authentication working
- Can fetch videos from playlists
- Handles pagination

### Milestone 2: Integrate LLM Matching ✅
- Using OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo
- Batch processing implemented
- Basic error handling in place

### Milestone 3: Move Videos ✅
- Can move or copy videos between playlists
- Supports both move and copy operations
- Basic error handling implemented

### Milestone 4: Logging & User Feedback ✅
- Added verbose output option
- Uses emojis for status (✅/❌)
- Added before/after playlist counts
- Added detailed error logging
- Added debug logging option
- Added operation statistics
- Added video status breakdown

### Milestone 5: Scaling & Error Handling ✅
- Batch processing for LLM calls
- True batch operations with YouTube API
- Smart request bundling for efficiency
- Parallel playlist processing
- Basic error handling for API calls
- Rate limit handling with exponential backoff
- Custom error classes for different failure types
- Retry decorator for transient errors
- Improved handling of private/deleted videos
- Detailed logging of skipped videos
- Defensive data extraction for malformed responses
- Network failure handling and testing
- Recovery from interruptions
- Token refresh handling
- State persistence and resume
- Tested with large playlists (1000+ videos)

### Milestone 6: Undo Support ✅
- Implement undo state tracking
- Add undo command to CLI
- Support undoing move operations
- Support undoing copy operations
- Add operation preview
- Add confirmation prompts
- Handle error cases
- Add tests for undo functionality

### Milestone 7: Final Review & Organization ✅
- Code organized into modules
- Comprehensive documentation
- Command-line interface
- Added utility scripts
- Unit tests with 76% coverage
  - 100% coverage: auth, config, quota, undo, utils
  - 95% coverage: distribute
  - 80-90% coverage: cache, common, logging, recovery
  - 70-80% coverage: classifier, consolidate
  - 68% coverage: api (improved from 30-40%)
  - 60-70% coverage: cli

## Future Considerations
- If performance becomes an issue, consider evaluating alternative LLM providers
- If test coverage drops significantly, prioritize improving it
- Monitor YouTube API changes that might affect the application
